Adding a new plugin
===================

* Open the plugin script in Fiji's script editor unless it is Java code.
* Use File > Export as .jar
* Extract the .java file from the generated .jar file (unzip).
* Add it to this directory.
* Edit "plugins.config" accordingly to have the new plugin show up in ImageJ's
  "Plugin" menu structure with the desired name.
